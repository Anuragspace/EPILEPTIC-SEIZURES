# AUTOMATED DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURES USING EEG DATA AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN MATLAB

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide, characterized by recurrent seizures that significantly impact quality of life and pose serious health risks. This project presents an automated machine learning-based system for detecting and classifying epileptic seizures from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Using the BEED (Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset) containing 8,000 balanced EEG recordings across four clinical classes, we developed a comprehensive analysis pipeline incorporating signal preprocessing, multi-domain feature extraction, intelligent feature selection, and systematic evaluation of six machine learning classifiers. The Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest classification accuracy of **78.50%** with exceptional performance on healthy controls (99.92% F1-Score) and reliable detection across all seizure types.

## 2. INTRODUCTION

### 2.1 Background

Epilepsy represents one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting approximately 1% of the global population. The hallmark of epilepsy is the occurrence of spontaneous, recurrent seizures resulting from abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Early and accurate seizure detection is critical for:

- **Clinical Management**: Enabling timely therapeutic intervention to prevent seizure progression and complications
- **Patient Safety**: Allowing patients and caregivers to take preventive measures during high-risk periods
- **Treatment Optimization**: Helping neurologists adjust medication and therapeutic strategies based on seizure frequency and severity
- **Quality of Life**: Reducing sudden unexpected nocturnal death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk and improving patient autonomy

EEG (electroencephalography) is the gold standard non-invasive neurophysiological monitoring technique for epilepsy diagnosis and management. However, manual interpretation of continuous EEG recordings is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. Automated seizure detection systems can process large volumes of EEG data objectively and reliably, reducing physician workload while improving diagnostic accuracy.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Manual review of EEG recordings for seizure detection is labor-intensive, subjective, and exhibits inter-rater variability (typically 70-90% accuracy among human experts).

**Objectives**:
1. Develop an automated system for reliable detection and multi-class classification of epileptic seizures from EEG signals
2. Identify the most discriminative EEG features that characterize different seizure types and healthy brain activity
3. Compare and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to determine optimal classification performance
4. Achieve clinically acceptable accuracy (>75%) while maintaining high specificity to minimize false alarms

### 2.3 Clinical Significance

This project addresses the critical need for automated, objective seizure detection in clinical and research settings, with potential applications in:
- Wearable seizure detection devices for continuous monitoring
- Intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring systems for acute seizure management
- Epilepsy surgery outcome prediction and monitoring
- Remote patient monitoring in resource-limited settings

### 4.2 Stage 1: Signal Preprocessing

Preprocessing aims to enhance signal quality, remove artifacts, and prepare EEG data for robust feature extraction.

**Step 1.1 - DC Offset Removal**:
- Removes baseline drift caused by electrode polarization
- Operation: X_demeaned = X - mean(X) per channel
- Result: Zero-mean signals for each EEG channel

**Step 1.2 - Bandpass Filtering (0.5-40 Hz)**:
- Removes DC component and high-frequency noise
- Preserves epileptically relevant frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- Filter Type: 4th-order Butterworth bandpass filter
- Rationale: Clinical EEG analysis typically focuses on <40 Hz frequencies; frequencies >40 Hz are predominantly muscle artifacts

**Step 1.3 - Notch Filtering (50 Hz)**:
- Removes power line interference (50 Hz in countries using 50 Hz AC)
- Critical for Europe, Asia, Africa, and other regions using 50 Hz electrical standards
- Filter Type: IIR notch filter with narrow bandwidth (1.43 Hz)
- Result: Elimination of 50 Hz and harmonics without distorting nearby EEG frequencies

**Step 1.4 - Artifact Detection and Handling**:
- Identifies and mitigates extreme amplitude values (>3σ)
- Artifacts Detected: 3,098 values (2.42% of total data)
- Strategy: Value clipping rather than sample removal to preserve temporal continuity
- Preserves physiological data while suppressing noise extremes

**Step 1.5 - Z-Score Normalization**:
- Standardizes each channel to zero mean and unit variance
- Formula: X_normalized = (X - μ) / σ
- Benefit: Equalizes feature scales, improving machine learning convergence
- Per-channel normalization ensures independent channel calibration

**Preprocessing Result**: From the console output, preprocessing successfully handled the entire 8,000-sample dataset, identifying and managing 2.42% artifacts while preserving signal integrity.

### 4.3 Stage 2: Feature Extraction (30 Features)

Extracted features span multiple domains to capture diverse EEG characteristics.

#### 4.3.1 Time-Domain Features (7 features)

**Statistical Descriptors** (computed per sample across 16 channels):

1. **Mean**: Average amplitude across channels
   - Represents overall signal level
   - Sensitivity to sustained activity changes

2. **Standard Deviation**: Measures amplitude variability
   - High values indicate high-frequency or irregular activity
   - Low values suggest sustained, regular patterns

3. **Variance**: Square of standard deviation
   - Emphasizes large amplitude deviations
   - Discriminates seizure-induced turbulence from normal rhythmic activity

4. **Skewness**: Asymmetry of amplitude distribution
   - Seizures typically show non-symmetric waveforms
   - Healthy EEG tends toward symmetric distributions

5. **Kurtosis**: Tail heaviness of amplitude distribution
   - Measures probability of extreme values
   - Seizures exhibit heavier tails (more extreme peaks)

6. **Root Mean Square (RMS)**: Energy indicator
   - Formula: RMS = √(mean(X²))
   - Reflects overall signal power
   - Seizures typically show elevated RMS

7. **Peak Amplitude**: Maximum absolute value
   - Distinguishes high-amplitude seizure spikes
   - Simple but effective discriminator

#### 4.3.2 Frequency-Domain Features (11 features)

**Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis** using Welch's Method:

Power Spectral Density reveals the distribution of signal energy across frequency bands, which varies dramatically between healthy and seizure states.

**Frequency Bands** (International Standard):
- **Delta (0.5-4 Hz)**: Associated with sleep, coma, and serious disease states
- **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Related to drowsiness and emotional stress
- **Alpha (8-13 Hz)**: Dominant frequency in awake, relaxed states
- **Beta (13-30 Hz)**: Associated with active thinking and muscle tension
- **Gamma (30-40 Hz)**: High-frequency oscillations related to cognitive processing

**Features Extracted**:
1. **Delta Power**: Increases dramatically during seizures (pathological delta activity)
2. **Theta Power**: Often elevated during focal seizures
3. **Alpha Power**: Typically suppressed during seizure activity
4. **Beta Power**: Variable changes depending on seizure type
5. **Gamma Power**: May increase during certain seizure types
6. **Relative Delta/Theta/Alpha/Beta/Gamma**: Normalized band powers (0-1 range)
   - Formula: RelBand = BandPower / TotalPower
   - Eliminates individual differences in overall amplitude
7. **Spectral Entropy**: Disorder measure of frequency distribution
   - Formula: S = -Σ(p_i × log₂(p_i)) where p_i = normalized PSD
   - High entropy = random, noise-like signals
   - Low entropy = organized, repetitive patterns
   - Seizures exhibit lower spectral entropy due to synchronized activity

#### 4.3.3 Wavelet-Based Features (6 features)

**Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** captures time-frequency information superior to traditional Fourier analysis.

**Rationale**: Unlike FFT which shows only frequency content, wavelets reveal WHEN different frequencies occur—crucial for detecting seizure onset and propagation.

**Implementation**:
- Wavelet: Daubechies-4 (db4) - optimal for EEG analysis
- Decomposition Levels: 4
- Coefficients:
  - D1 (Detail 1): 128-256 Hz (high-frequency artifacts/noise)
  - D2 (Detail 2): 64-128 Hz (gamma oscillations)
  - D3 (Detail 3): 32-64 Hz (beta band)
  - D4 (Detail 4): 16-32 Hz (beta/alpha transition)
  - A4 (Approximation 4): 0-16 Hz (delta/theta/low alpha)

**Features**:
1. **Wavelet Energy D1-D4, A4** (5 features): Sum of squared coefficients per level
   - Formula: E_level = Σ(coefficients²)
   - Indicates energy concentration in frequency bands
   - Seizures show altered energy distribution

2. **Wavelet Entropy** (1 feature): Entropy of normalized wavelet energies
   - Formula: H_w = -Σ(p_i × log₂(p_i)) where p_i = normalized energy
   - Low entropy during organized seizure activity
   - High entropy during normal, random-like brain activity

#### 4.3.4 Entropy-Based Features (2 features)

**Approximate Entropy (ApEn)**:
- Measures regularity and predictability of signals
- Formula complexity: Compares patterns of length m and m+1
- Parameters: m=2, r=0.2×std
- Interpretation: Low ApEn = regular, predictable (seizure); High ApEn = irregular, random (normal)

**Sample Entropy (SampEn)**:
- Improved version of ApEn, bias-corrected
- Formula: SampEn = -log(A/B) where A,B are pattern matches
- More robust to data length variations than ApEn
- Clinical interpretation: Reduced sample entropy during seizures

#### 4.3.5 Additional Unique Features (4 features)

1. **Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)** (1 feature):
   - Counts sign changes in signal: ZCR = Σ(sign(X[n]) ≠ sign(X[n+1])) / (N-1)
   - Indicates frequency content implicitly
   - High ZCR suggests high-frequency components

2. **Hjorth Parameters** (3 features):
   - **Activity**: Variance of signal (similar to power)
   - **Mobility**: Variance of first derivative / Variance of signal
     - Formula: M = √(var(dx)/var(x))
     - Indicates predominant frequency
   - **Complexity**: Mobility of derivative / Mobility of signal
     - Formula: C = Mobility(dx) / Mobility(x)
     - Compares signal complexity to its derivatives
   - Clinical Value: Seizures show characteristic Hjorth parameter signatures

**Total Features Extracted**: 30 features providing comprehensive EEG characterization.

### 4.4 Stage 3: Feature Selection (30 → 8 Features)

**Console Output**: Removed 3 highly correlated features, 16 statistically significant features selected, 11 PCA components retained, final selection reduced to **8 features (73% reduction)**.

#### 4.4.1 Method 1: Correlation-Based Feature Selection

- **Threshold**: r > 0.95
- **Features Removed**: 3 highly redundant features
- **Rationale**: Correlated features provide redundant information; removing one preserves discriminative power while reducing noise

#### 4.4.2 Method 2: ANOVA F-Test

- **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.05
- **Features Retained**: 16 features
- **Rationale**: Tests whether each feature significantly differs across the four seizure classes
- **Formula**: F = (Between-group variance) / (Within-group variance)
- **Result**: Only features with significant class-specific variations retained

#### 4.4.3 Method 3: Mutual Information (MI)

- **Information-Theoretic Approach**: Measures mutual dependence between feature and class labels
- **Advantage**: Captures nonlinear relationships unlike correlation
- **Formula**: I(X;Y) = Σ P(x,y) × log₂(P(x,y) / (P(x)×P(y)))
- **Interpretation**: Higher MI = feature more informative about class membership

#### 4.4.4 Method 4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- **Objective**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving 95% variance
- **Console Output**: 11 principal components explain 95% variance
- **Benefit**: Orthogonal transformation eliminates multicollinearity

- **Importance Metric**: Out-of-Bag Permutation Error Reduction
- **Rationale**: Features causing largest prediction errors when shuffled are most important
- **Advantage**: Captures feature interactions and nonlinearities

#### 4.4.6 Feature Combination

**Weighted Average Score**:
Score = 0.3 × F_score_norm + 0.3 × MI_norm + 0.4 × RF_importance_norm

- Weights emphasize Random Forest importance (40%) as most comprehensive
- Equal weight to F-test and MI (30% each) for robustness
- **Final Selection**: Top 8 features (minimum of 30 features or 50% of significant features)

**Result**: 8 optimally selected features capturing 95%+ of classification-relevant information while eliminating redundancy and noise.

## 9. CONCLUSIONS

### 9.1 Summary

This project successfully developed an automated machine learning system for detecting and classifying epileptic seizures from EEG signals. Using the BEED dataset containing 8,000 balanced multi-class examples, we implemented a comprehensive five-stage pipeline encompassing signal preprocessing, multi-domain feature extraction, intelligent dimensionality reduction, and systematic algorithm evaluation.

**Key Findings**:

1. **Optimal Algorithm**: Random Forest achieved highest accuracy (78.50%) with excellent specificity (92.83%) and near-perfect healthy control detection (100% sensitivity, 99.92% F1-Score)

2. **Effective Feature Engineering**: 30 carefully engineered features across time, frequency, wavelet, and entropy domains captured sufficient discriminative information for robust classification with only 8 final features

3. **Clinical Feasibility**: System meets minimum accuracy threshold (75%) and demonstrates acceptable false alarm rate (7.17%), making it suitable for clinical decision support

4. **Algorithm Comparison**: Systematic evaluation of six classifiers revealed Random Forest superiority, with trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability vs. speed

5. **Performance Variability**: Per-class analysis revealed class-specific performance differences reflecting inherent complexity differences (healthy vs. seizure types)

### 9.2 Key Contributions

1. **Comprehensive Methodology**: Multi-domain feature extraction and hybrid feature selection represent best practices in EEG analysis

2. **Reproducible Implementation**: Complete MATLAB implementation enables reproducibility and facilitates clinical translation

3. **Transparent Reporting**: Detailed performance metrics, visualizations, and per-class analysis enable critical evaluation

4. **Practical System**: Fully automated pipeline from raw data to clinical report addresses real clinical workflow needs

### 9.3 Future Directions

**Scientific Advancement**:

2. Patient-specific model adaptation (transfer learning)
3. Multi-modal integration (EEG + clinical features + imaging)
4. Seizure type-specific models for improved performance
5. Uncertainty quantification for clinical risk assessment

**Clinical Translation**:
1. Clinical trial validation against expert neurologists
2. Regulatory approval pathway (FDA/CE Mark)
3. Integration into hospital EEG monitoring systems
4. Wearable device implementation for continuous monitoring
5. Telehealth platform development for remote monitoring

**Technical Enhancement**:

5. Open-source software package release

### 9.4 Final Statement

This project demonstrates the viability of machine learning approaches for automated seizure detection from EEG signals. While performance (78.50% accuracy) remains below clinical ideal for fully autonomous deployment, it represents a solid foundation for clinical decision support systems and provides a systematic framework for further research and development.

The Random Forest classifier's high specificity (92.83%) makes it particularly valuable for generating high-confidence seizure alerts without excessive false alarms, a critical feature for practical clinical adoption. The system's ability to perfectly discriminate healthy controls (100% sensitivity) further supports its use as a screening tool in high-volume clinical settings.

With ongoing refinement, multi-modal integration, and clinical validation, such systems have substantial potential to improve seizure management, enhance patient safety, and reduce the burden of manual EEG interpretation in clinical and research settings worldwide.
